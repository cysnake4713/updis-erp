    "description": """
Mark fields not to show up in the list of exportable fields, nor in the list
of fields in an advanced filter. Go to Administration ->
Customizations -> Database Structure -> Fields. For fields that you do not want
to show up in the export list, check the box 'Exclude from export'.

Applies to the Export widget in the web client only (GTK client not supported)

Warning: this is a hackish module. Due to the applied technology of 'monkeypatching',
when installed on any database of an OpenERP instance, this module may affect the
functionality of all databases of that instance.
